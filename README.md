## The Secret Trick (Operator's Manual)

The result is determined by **WHERE** you click the large Fingerprint button on the Start screen.

-   **Click Left Side (0% - 40%)**: Result will be **TRUE** (Green).
-   **Click Right Side (60% - 100%)**: Result will be **LIE** (Red).
-   **Click Center (40% - 60%)**: Result will be **RANDOM**.

The button looks uniform, so the subject won't notice you aiming for a specific side.

## Features

-   **Cyberpunk Visuals**: Scanlines, noise, neon colors.
-   **Fake Analysis**: 4-second sequence of "biometric readings".
-   **Audio Effects**: Generated sound effects for scanning and results.
-   **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile.
